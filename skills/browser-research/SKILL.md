# Browser Research (Chrome/Chromium-first)

Use this skill when:
- the task needs a real browser session (auth, dynamic UI, screenshots), OR
- you need to reproduce/inspect a real site.

Default approach:
1) Prefer built-in web search for docs or static info.
2) If a real browser is required, use Chrome DevTools MCP.
3) Summarize findings with:
   - what you did
   - what you observed
   - screenshots/URLs if relevant
   - next steps

Reference:
- See `browser_research.md` in this directory for additional guidance.
